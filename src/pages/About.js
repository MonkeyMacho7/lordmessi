        <h2>My Journey as a Messi Fan</h2>
        <p>
          I have been a devoted fan of Lionel Messi since **2007**. Growing up, I watched all of his games—
          every goal, every assist, every magical moment. Whether it was his breathtaking dribbles, 
          historic wins, or heartbreaking losses, I followed every step of his career. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Watching Messi dominate football has been one of the greatest joys of my life. From his early days at 
          **Barcelona**, to lifting the **World Cup** with Argentina, his journey has inspired me in so many ways.
